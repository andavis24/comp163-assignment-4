# College Life Adventure Game

This project is Assignment 4 for COMP 163.  
It is a text-based, interactive game where you make decisions as a college student.  
Each decision changes your GPA, study hours, social points, and stress level, ultimately leading to different possible endings.

## Game Concept

You play as a college student navigating the challenges of a semester.  
From selecting your course load to deciding how you’ll study, each choice impacts your academic performance, social life, and stress.  
The purpose of this game is to show how branching logic in Python can create different outcomes from the same starting point, similar to how real-life college decisions shape your experience.

## Branching Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates all the required Python branching and operator concepts:

- **If/Else Statements:** Implemented in the course planning decision to adjust study hours and stress level.
- **Comparison Operators (>=, <=, ==, !=):** Used to check GPA levels and determine different course outcomes.
- **Membership Operators (in, not in):** Validate user study strategy input against a list of available subjects.
- **Logical Operators (and, or, not):** Combine multiple conditions to affect GPA and social points during the study strategy decision.
- **Identity Operators (is, is not):** Applied for type checking in the final semester assessment.
- **Nested If Statements:** Used in the final assessment to produce different endings with at least two levels of logic.
